## About The Project

This is my final project for the Basics of Web Application class. Its fully responsive SPA made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery library. It fetches my projects from github API and displays them in cards. It has hacky navigation with smooth scrolling achieved by using radio buttons and JS. It uses local storage to store multiple contact me forms, user can chose and edit them and save to send later made as an intro to CRUD.
